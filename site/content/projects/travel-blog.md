The power to create very fast, secure and reliable fully featured static web pages: <b>Github + Hugo + Netlify + Netlify-CMS</b>

Also includes out of the box <a>Disqus</a> blog integration and Google analytics.

I added <a>Cloudinary</a> support as the main platform for managing pictures. The main advantage for using this platform is their free tier, however, their more limited paid tier is a bit expensive for small/medium size personal websites... I think it would be a good idea implementing a "pay for what you use" tier like their competence.
