The power to create very fast, secure and reliable fully featured static web pages: **Github + Hugo + Netlify + Netlify-CMS**

Also includes out of the box **Disqus** blog integration and Google analytics.

I added **Cloudinary** support as the main platform for managing pictures. The main advantage ofusing this platform is their free tier, however, their more limited paid tier is a bit expensive for small/medium size personal websites. I think it would be a good idea implementing a "pay for what you use" tier like their competence.
