**I was born to become an Engineer.**
This is something that I knew since I was around 7 years old:
I was fascinated by rechargeable batteries when my father found some D size lead batteries and built a charger for me. The best was that I could run my electric train without the need to go ask my parents for more batteries. Also, I manage to tune channels on a very old TV using a remote controller which buttons markings were worn off: the solution was to press the two symmetric buttons at the bottom at the same time.
I have been always very enthusiastic about computers or anything programmable. I still remember when we got from a relative, a green display computer which used these old slim floppy disks.

**In 2007**, I started Electrical Engineering at Malaga University (Spain), where I acquired a deep understanding of mathematical abstraction, applied physics and electrical machines.

During the first year in the university, I was introduced to the programming language C and it blew my mind. I could spend hours trying to solve one problem.

**In 2011**, I went on an Erasmus scholarship to study Mechatronics to VIA University College in Horsens (Denmark). I chose deliberately all computer related subjects and some about electronics. I really enjoyed the subjects Fuzzy logic and Neural Networks for image recognition and hardware-oriented programming. 

Here, I met some software engineers who motivated me to learn more about computer science and programming. This is when I started using Arch Linux on my personal computer.


When I finished my bachelors degree in Malaga University, **in 2014**, I moved to Bristol (UK), where I currently reside.

Only 2 weeks after I arrived in Bristol, I was hired by Bluewire Technologies, which develops a Patient Record application for the NHS, on the role of DevOps. However, like in I guess happens very often, I was not doing any **Dev** but only **Ops**.
**After 3 years working here**, I acquired a lot of commercial experience, running deployments and troubleshooting production, coordinating with our clients and helping the team to improve our product.

**In June 2017**, I quit my job in Bluewire and started working on my [personal projects](https://blgo.netlify.com/#projects). However, I knew that I would need to improve my skills in a large number of technologies: Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript... and all the libraries, modules, tools, APIs, web services that I would need to use.

Now, I am keen to find my place in the **Software Engineering** market and I am **very enthusiastic** about learning anything required to **succeed in this quest**.
