<b>I was born to become an Engineer.</b>
 
This is something that I knew since I was around 7 years old:
I  was fascinated about rechargable batteries when my father found some D size lead batteries and built a charger for me. The best was that I could run my electri train without the need to go ask my parents for more batteries. 
Also, I manage to tune channels on a very old TV using a remote controller which buttons markings were worn off: the solution was to press the two buttons at the bottom at the same time, then the TV would start searching channels.

I have been always very enthusiastic about computers or anything programmable. I still remember when we got from a relative, a green display computer which used these old slim floppy disks.

On 2007, I started Electrical Engineering in Malaga University (Spain),  where I adquired a deep understanding on mathematical abstraction, applied physics and electrical machines. 

During the first year in the university, I was introduced to the programmong language C and it blew my mind. I could spend hours trying to solve one problem.

on 2011, I went on a Erasmus scholarship to study Mechatronics to VIA University College in Horsens (Denmark). I choosed deliverately all computer related subjects and some about electronics. I really enjoyed te subjects Fuzzy logic and Neural Networks for image recognition and hardware oriented programming. Here, I met some software engineers who motivated me to learn more about computer science and programming. This is when I started using Arch Linux in my personal computer.

Between 2012 and 2014 I finished my studies in Malaga and moved to Bristol (UK), where I currently reside. 

Only 2 weeks after I arrived to Bristol, I was hired by Bluewire Technologies, which develops a Patient Record application for the NHS, on the role of DevOps. However, like in I guess happens very often, I was not doing any <b>Dev</b> but only <b>Ops</b>. 

After 3 years working here, I adquired a lot of commercial experience, running deployments and troubleshootin production, coordinating with our clients and helping the team to improve our product.

In June 2017, I quited my job in Bluewire and started working on my <a href="http://blgo.netlify.com/#projects">personal projects</a>. However, I knew that I would need to improve my skills in a large amount of technologies: Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript... and all the libraries, modules, tools, apis, web services that I would need to use.
 
Now, I am keen to find my place on the Software Engineering market and I am very enthusiastic about learning anything required to succeeed in this quest.
