**In June 2017**, I quit at Bluewire and started working on my [personal projects](https://blgo.netlify.com/#projects). 

I knew this would be a big challenge and that I would need to improve my skills in a large number of technologies: Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript... and any  frameworks, libraries, modules, tools, APIs and architectures that I would need to use.

Now, I am keen to find my place in the **Software Engineering** market and I am **very enthusiastic** about learning anything required to **succeed in this quest**.

If you would like to know me a bit better, please continue reading or go to the [projects](https://blgo.netlify.com/#projects) section.



**I was born to be an Engineer.**
This is something that I knew since I was around 7 years old:
I was fascinated by rechargeable batteries when my father found some D size lead batteries and built a charger for me. I could run my electric train without the need to ask my parents for more batteries. 

I have always been very enthusiastic about computers and anything programmable. I still remember when we got from a relative, a computer with a green display which used very slim floppy disks.

When we had our first PC Pentium III, I could watch my brother for hours trying to fix something in Windows and then I would ask and try to understand what was happening and why.

Only after I bought a Play Station Portable with my first salary at the age of 16 in a summer job; I started doing more than troubleshooting Windows and started digging into the PSP Homebrew scene at [the beginning](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/PSP/Homebrew_History#The_Beginning). However, I never tryed to try the "Hello World" because it looked like rocket science to me at the time.

**In 2007**, I started Electrical Engineering at Malaga University (Spain), where I acquired a deep understanding of mathematical abstraction, applied physics and electrical machines.

During the first year, I was introduced to the C programming and it blew my mind. I could spend hours and weeks trying to solve a problem and the satisfaction of making it work and understanding it.

**In 2011**, I went on an Erasmus scholarship to study Mechatronics to VIA University College in Horsens (Denmark). I chose computer sciences and electronic engineering subjects. I really enjoyed studing the subjects Vision Systems, Fuzzy logic and Neural Networks for image recognition and hardware-oriented programming. 

Here, I met some software engineers who motivated me to learn more about computer science and programming. This is when I started using Arch Linux on my personal computer.

When I finished my bachelors degree in Malaga University, **in 2014**, I moved to Bristol (UK), where I currently reside.

Two  weeks after I arrived in Bristol, I was hired by Bluewire Technologies, where I helped improving and supporting our Eletronic Patient Record system - [Epro](https://www.epro.com) - for the NHS, in the role of DevOps. My tasks involved troubleshooting server and application issues for several NHS hospitals, maintaining infrastructure, databases administration, automating test enviroments; planning, testing and troubleshooting database migrations and deployments to production servers.
